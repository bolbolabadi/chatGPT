## Hashtag Recommender

Here is an example of how you could write a Python function that takes in a string of content and recommends three hashtags based on the most repetitive words in the content:

```python
import re
from collections import Counter

def recommend_hashtags(content: str) -> List[str]:
    # split the content into words
    words = content.split()

    # create a dictionary to store the word frequencies
    word_counts = {}

    # iterate through the words
    for word in words:
        # check if the word is a hashtag
        if word.startswith('#'):
            # skip hashtags
            continue

        # increment the word count
        if word in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] += 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] = 1

    # sort the word frequencies in descending order
    sorted_word_counts = sorted(word_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # create a list of hashtags
    hashtags = []

    # add the top 3 words as hashtags
    for i in range(3):
        # get the word and frequency
        word, count = sorted_word_counts[i]

        # create the hashtag
        hashtag = '#' + word

        # add the hashtag to the list
        hashtags.append(hashtag)

    return hashtags
```

This function first splits the content into a list of words using the split() method. It then iterates through the words and skips any that start with a hashtag symbol ('#'). For the other words, it increments a count in a dictionary for each unique word.

The function then sorts the dictionary of word counts in descending order by frequency and creates a list of hashtags based on the top 3 most frequent words. It then returns the list of hashtags.

You can customize this function to fit your specific needs. For example, you could modify the regex pattern used to identify hashtags or change the number of hashtags returned.
