```bash
cat URLS.txt | xargs -P 10 -n 1 gospider --blacklist ".(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|tif|tiff|png|ttf|woff|woff2|ico|pdf|svg|txt)" --other-source | grep -e "code-200" | awk '{print $5}'| grep "=" | qsreplace -a | dalfox pipe | tee OUT.txt
```
The command provided uses several tools to extract hyperlinks from a list of URLs in a file called `URLS.txt`. The cat command is used to read the contents of the URLS.txt file, and the xargs command is used to run multiple instances of the gospider command in parallel. The gospider command is then used to crawl the URLs in the file, and the `--blacklist` and `--other-source` options are used to exclude certain types of URLs from the crawl.

The output of the gospider command is then piped to the grep command, which filters the output for URLs that return a 200 HTTP status code. The output is then piped to the awk command, which extracts the URL from the output. The output is then piped to the grep command again, which filters the output for URLs that contain a query string. The output is then piped to the qsreplace command, which removes the query strings from the URLs.

The output is then piped to the dalfox command, which runs a security scan on the URLs. Finally, the output is piped to the tee command, which saves the results to a file called OUT.txt.
